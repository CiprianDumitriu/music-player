Waves â€“ Music Player:

Waves is a passion project born from my love of music. It was created to highlight my skills in React, most importantly States and Props. Other technologies used are SASS and FontAwesome. Key features of the project are:
-	Working music player that can pause or change tracks
-	Animated library which shows current song and  that can change song by clicking
-	Implementation of UUID
